Build Process
=============
Traditionally, you converted your LaTeX source file to a DVI file, which could then be 
converted to PostScript with dvips.  This, in turn, can be converted to a PDF file by 
ps2pdf:

		  latex		    dvips	     ps2pdf
	text.tex -------> text.dvi -------> text.ps --------> text.pdf

This requires all the graphics to be EPS files. But that's not a major problem, as raster 
graphics can be converted to EPS.  Furthermore, the scalability of vector graphics means 
clean-looking figures at all resolutions. And vector PS is usually very compact.

But what about using photographs, which are usually saved as JPEGs? This really isn't a 
problem, because the jpeg2ps command (from Debian's jpeg2ps package) wraps JPEG images 
in an EPS header.
