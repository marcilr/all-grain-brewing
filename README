Have one already!

Abstract
This document contains LATEX Templete with Examples

The all-grain.pdf is still my template document.
Needs to be updated.

o I really liked the 3 pot details:

"A traditional all-gram system consists of 3 vessels:

o Hot Liquot tank (HLT)

============================
Set subversion property such that that svninfo keywords get expanded in all-grain-brewing.tex
file:

$ svn propset svn:keywords "Id" all-grain-bewing.tex
property 'svn:keywords' set on 'all-grain-bewing.tex'

Build Process
=============
Traditionally, you converted your LaTeX source file to a DVI file, which could then be 
converted to PostScript with dvips.  This, in turn, can be converted to a PDF file by 
ps2pdf:

		  latex		    dvips	     ps2pdf
	text.tex -------> text.dvi -------> text.ps --------> text.pdf

This requires all the graphics to be EPS files. But that's not a major problem, as raster 
graphics can be converted to EPS.  Furthermore, the scalability of vector graphics means 
clean-looking figures at all resolutions. And vector PS is usually very compact.

But what about using photographs, which are usually saved as JPEGs? This really isn't a 
problem, because the jpeg2ps command (from Debian's jpeg2ps package) wraps JPEG images 
in an EPS header.
